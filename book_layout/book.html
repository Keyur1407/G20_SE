      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
       The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg explores the science behind habit formation and how they can be changed. The book introduces the concept of the "habit loop"—a cycle of cue, routine, and reward—that shapes behavior. Duhigg explains how understanding and manipulating this loop can help individuals break bad habits and develop new, positive ones. The book also delves into how organizations can harness habits to drive success and how societal habits influence collective behavior and social change. Ultimately, Duhigg emphasizes that while habits are powerful, they are not fixed and can be reshaped to improve personal, organizational, and societal outcomes.
